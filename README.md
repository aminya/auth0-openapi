# Auth0 Authentication API

The OpenAPI specification for the Auth0 Authentication API.

## OpenAPI Specification

In this repository, the OpenAPI specification that describes the Auth0 Authentication API is provided.

The Auth0 Authentication API enables you to manage all aspects of user identity when you use Auth0. It offers endpoints so your users can log in, sign up, log out, access APIs, and more. The API supports various identity protocols, like OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.

This specification can be used for various purposes, such as:

- Generate client libraries in many languages (via [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)). This is particularly useful for the programming languages that are not officially supported by Auth0.

- Generate server stubs in many languages (via [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/))

- Generate interactive documentation (via [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/), [RapiDoc](https://rapidocweb.com/), [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc))
